# info-code
A simple method to describe code information. (Things that matter), when TS is not needed...

### TS Pros:
* easier traversal of annotated objects
* better schema definitions for functions and classes
* type safety, early warnings on improper usage, and yes, sometimes safer code like having to check for null
* easier inline documentation for those that can read TS
* beneficial to developers coming from static typed languages mindset, (C++, C#, Java...)

### TS Cons:
* discarding Javascript powers and mindset, such as simplicity, Dynamic typing,...
* only works at the development time, at the run-time TS is removed
* extra learning curve, which is non productive.
* if architecting types and type systems done poorly code can be unreadable.
* env dependencies and library workarounds at times of lacking support.
* false sense of 'error free' and (depending on team experience) a devaluing of unit testing due to the assumption that TS prevents bugs
